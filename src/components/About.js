    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>For ten years, I ignited young minds in classrooms across the US. Teaching honed my patience, communication, and planning skills. Witnessing the need for tech that empowers educators, I transitioned to full-stack development. Now, I translate my passion for learning and creating into code, all while exploring new trails with my dog or savoring delicious discoveries.</p>
